# Limbo

You have to edit limbo.py and include the desired server and client seeds, because idk what happened I just can't make them work right with an input. 

The dice one may run into the same issue but so far has been okay.

Usage:

open cmd to the folder
`py limbo.py`
it will create a csv file with the desired number of rolls. 
Note that I didn't bother to have it make a new file every time, so you will have to make sure the old one is closed, it will overwrite it or error. I will fix that soon

(Actually, github thinks its too big, so I guess I can't include it yet I can upload it separately somewhere) If you have excel, I have also included stakelimbo.xlsm (xlsm is the excel macro format, as I have clear ranges macros. It will not start with macros enabled for security reasons).

It is an incredibly inefficient, unoptimized sheet, and can only handle 50k~100k rolls before getting very slow, but it works nicely for at a glance analysis.
