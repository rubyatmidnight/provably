# provably
Various docs and scripts for validating and analyzing Stake bet results

See the readmes inside each respective folder for more information and usage

Requirements: Python, a relatively new version is fine

misc folder: A few random scripts, one clicker for cashing out on crash (with some fiddling), and a slot machine I made... uwu.

These are applicable for Stake only, although many sites copy their implementation 1:1 and it may well work for those sites too. However, some sites (especially older ones) already had their own implementations. Bitsler is the only one I have specifically written other scripts for.
